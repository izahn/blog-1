      <description>Marginal effects in a linear model Stata’s margins command has been a powerful tool for many economists. It can calculate predicted means as well as predicted marginal effects. However, we do need to be careful when we use it when fixed effects are included. In a linear model, everything works out fine. However, in a non-linear model, you may not want to use margins, since it’s not calculating what you have in mind.</description>
