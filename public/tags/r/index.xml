      <description>A comparison of various count data models with extra zeros In empirical studies, data sets with a lot of zeros are often hard to model. There are various models to deal with it: zero-inflated Poisson model, Negative Binomial (NB)model, hurdle model, etc.
Here we are following a zero-inflated model’s thinking: model the data with two processes. One is a Bernoulli process, the other one is a count data process (Poisson or NB).</description>

      <description>A simulation for an OLS model In an observational study, we need to assume we have the functional form to get causal effect estimated correctly, in addtion to the assumption of treatment being exogenous.

      <description>Introduction In this post, I am trying to study the authorship of Dream of the Red Chamber (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_of_the_Red_Chamber). It has been controvertial who the author of the last 40 chapters of this most-well-known book in China. Many people believed that the first 80 chapters were written by Cao Xueqin, but the last 40 were additions by someone else.
