      <description>Introduction In this post, I am trying to study the authorship of Dream of the Red Chamber (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_of_the_Red_Chamber). It has been controvertial who the author of the last 40 chapters of this most-well-known book in China. Many people believed that the first 80 chapters were written by Cao Xueqin, but the last 40 were additions by someone else.
