      <description>Comparing Marginal effects Stata’s margins command has been a powerful tool for many economists. It can calculate predicted means as well as predicted marginal effects. In this post, I’d like to introduce a way to compare effects. Unfortunately plots generated by marginsplot cannot display. But you can still use the code to generate them in stata.
For example:
webuse nhanes2f, clear logit diabetes i.female##c.age, nolog margins female, at(age=(20 30 40 50 60 70)) marginsplot margins r.</description>

      <description>Marginal effects in a linear model Stata’s margins command has been a powerful tool for many economists. It can calculate predicted means as well as predicted marginal effects. However, we do need to be careful when we use it when fixed effects are included. In a linear model, everything works out fine. However, in a non-linear model, you may not want to use margins, since it’s not calculating what you have in mind.</description>

      <title>Treatment effects and matching</title>

      <description>Treatment effects in observational studies Despite the popularity of randomized experiements in economics nowadays, most situations we have observational data in economic studies. One reason is experiemnts are expensive; the other reason is that sometimes it is simply not feasible to have experiments. If we have observational data, and we’d like to draw causal conclusions, then we have a few different situations. The worse situation is that we have an endogenous treatement.</description>
